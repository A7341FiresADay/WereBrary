Get it running
-----

1. Install [unity3d](http://unity3d.com/unity/download)
2. Checkout the repo
3. Delete the ```werebrary/Assets/library``` folder.
4. Open the ```library.unity``` file.
5. Click window -> navigation, this will open the navigation panel. Click "bake". This regenerates the library folder.
6. Run the simulation


Where the Fun bits are
------------

- ```werebrary/Assets/scripts/PatronController.cs``` had a behavior tree and half the genetic alogrithms.
- ```werebrary/Assets/scripts/Gibberish.cs``` has a gibberish generator.
- ```werebrary/Assets/scripts/LibraryEntrance.cs``` has the rest of the genetics.
